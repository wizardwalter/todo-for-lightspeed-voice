# ToDo
1. download code from github
2. if you dont have angular or the cli download both as well as nodejs 
3. run npm i within a terminal pointing to the project to download all of the packages
4. within command prompt, have that point to backend, run npm start in the terminal, you should see server running on port 3000 and connection to db success
5. within vscode have that point to frontend or to-do, run ng serve and the angular frontend will run on port 4200
6. any issues with either of them try running npm install within the backend and frontend seperatly
7. any other issue just shoot me an email or give me a call
